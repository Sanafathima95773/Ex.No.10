## Aim:

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works using ChatGPT or similar AI models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content‚Äôs quality, coherence, and structure.

---

## Algorithm:

1. Start by studying the different **prompt patterns** (query decomposition, decision making, answer engineering, fact check list, tail generation, menu actions, semantic filter).
2. Choose the **content type** (report, article, case study, story, etc.).
3. Design **basic prompts** to generate an initial draft.
4. Refine prompts with advanced techniques such as decision making, tail generation, or semantic filtering.
5. Generate multiple drafts to compare content coherence, accuracy, and creativity.
6. Evaluate the outputs for structure, tone, accuracy, and originality.
7. Iterate and improve prompts until a polished final version is achieved.

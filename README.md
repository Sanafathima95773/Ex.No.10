Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.
```
Procedure:
Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns: ○ Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts. ○ Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions. ○ Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer. ○ Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies. ○ Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis. ○ Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one. ○ Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be: ○ Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.) ○ Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations) ○ Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles) ○ Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
Creating the Prompts: ○ Start with simple prompts to generate initial content. ○ Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments: ○ For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights. ○ For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for: ○ Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured? ○ Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh? ○ Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)? ○ Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

Menu Actions	Presents selectable options
Semantic Filter	Adjusts tone, style, voice, or vocabulary
🧾 Choosing the Content Type
You can generate the following types of content using the above prompt patterns:

✅ Reports (e.g., market trend analysis, sustainability reviews)
✅ Case Studies (e.g., business/tech success)
✅ Articles (e.g., education, awareness)
✅ Creative Writing (e.g., sci-fi stories, video scripts)
🧪 Test Scenarios Used
Business Report on Market Trends
Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story
🧪 Scenario 1: Business Report on Market Trends (Electric Vehicles)
This scenario demonstrates how to generate and refine a business report on market trends in the electric vehicle (EV) industry using AI prompt patterns. The steps below illustrate the evolution from a basic draft to a polished, structured report using advanced prompt engineering techniques.

🔹 Step 1: Basic Prompt (First Draft)
🧩 Prompt Used
Write a short business report on current market trends in the electric vehicle (EV) industry.

🧠 Prompt Patterns Used:
Query Decomposition: Narrowed the topic to the EV industry Answer Engineering (basic): Expected a business report format

📄 Output (First Draft)
The electric vehicle (EV) industry has shown robust growth in recent years, driven by increasing consumer demand, supportive government policies, and technological advancements in battery efficiency. Global EV sales rose 40% in 2024, with China, the US, and Europe leading the way. Major automakers continue to expand their EV offerings, while startups enter the market with niche solutions. However, challenges remain around battery supply chains, charging infrastructure, and raw material shortages.4

🔹 Step 2: Refined Prompt (Advanced Techniques)
🧩 Refined Prompt
Write a professional 2-page business report on market trends in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Structure the report with an executive summary, key trends, opportunities, challenges, and conclusion. Use a formal tone suitable for stakeholders in the auto and energy sectors. Include accurate, current data points and references to major players and technologies. Filter for concise, fact-based language.
